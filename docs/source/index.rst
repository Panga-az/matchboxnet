matchboxnet documentation
=========================
**MatchboxNet** â€“ an end-to-end neural network for speech command recognition.

MatchboxNet is a deep residual network composed from blocks of  
1D time-channel separable convolution, batch-normalization, ReLU, and dropout layers.

This package is created to provide a ready-to-use implementation of MatchboxNet  
for audio classification tasks using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.
